# 🔐 Secure Toolkit (Python GUI)

An all-in-one **security toolkit** built with **Python & Tkinter** that demonstrates modern
**password security, encryption, and file protection** techniques.

This project is suitable for **students, beginners in cybersecurity, and Python developers**
looking to build real-world secure applications.

- Password verification
- Password strength checker
- Secure random password generator
- Show / hide password toggle

### 🗂️ Password Manager
- Store website credentials securely
- AES encryption using **Fernet**
- Encrypted password storage in file
- View decrypted passwords inside the app only

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Passwords are **bcrypt-hashed** (one-way, cannot be decrypted)  
- Data encrypted with **Fernet (AES)** using auto-generated `secret.key`  
- Deleting `secret.key` makes encrypted data unrecoverable  
- Passwords are **never stored in plain text**  
- File encryption uses **AES-128**  
- Secure random values generated with **Python `secrets` module**  
- Decryption occurs **only in memory**, not written to disk
